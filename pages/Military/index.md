Yay

## Fully Automatic Circuitry

Traditional FA weapons use gas operated springs to set the next bullet in place from the previous fire's pressure.

But with a more electronic approach, we may not need to have such complex mechanisms, at least physically. And instead offload it to the builtin magazine springs and the actual circuit.

- if possible, dont use the entire capacitor bank's charge in one go. Instead either use a small set of it or just let it rip for less than a milisecond

### Coilgun

Most of all, the efficiency is just not great. Simulations and possible AI assisted (design, simulation and testing) would be really cool. We would need:

- an n-stage acceleration system -> basically a lot of copper wire (prob thin)

We split the idea into "long charges" and "short charges"

- long charges are between each emptying of the capacitor banks
- short charges are between each shot

### Thicker Wire?

Might be useful for generating a more powerful magnetic field. So the attraction vectors are much stronger.

- thicker wire (lower gauge) has less resistance, hence higher current output and higher B

### Better Batteries

More efficient and higher capacity battery systems will always be a good idea. Esp for long charges.

### Railgun

Railguns are a bit better in terms of efficiency apparently. Since they use the principle of EMP on dual channels rather than a single one.
