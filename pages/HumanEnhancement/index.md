Who cares about social and historical issues? And stuff like religion. We can just enhance the body.

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement)

## Existing Ways

So we enhance humans through reproductive, physical or mental manipulation.

Physical => cosmetics, drugs, prosthetics/exoskeletons, implants, organ replacements, strength training

Mental => nootropics, neurostimulation (usually electromagetic neuromodulation), techonologies like calculators and the internet to enhance cognitive efficiency

Reproductive => embryo selection by preimplantation genetics, cytoplasmic transfer, in vitro generated gametes
