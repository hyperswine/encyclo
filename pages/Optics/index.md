Optics are very good.

## Facts

Convex => literally means a polygon with interior angle sum <= 180deg. For optics, they minimise objects far away, until the focal length. Then it starts to turn the image upside down and slowly magnify as we increase the distance

Concave => Maximise objects farther away, making them bigger.

Note, the opposite is true if they are mirrors instead of lenses. Then the beams converge when concave. And diverge when convex.

## Porro Prisms

Named after a cool dude called porro. Basically a lens-mirror that reflects the beam when hit the end. We can use it to reflect the beam at 45 deg two times until the beam turns 180deg and exits out. Or we can just reflect it once at 45deg to turn it 90deg.

- increases the length that the light travels, so good for exploiting higher magnification potential in binoculars and telescopes
- in binoculars, two porro prisms are used to increase the effective distance that the light travels from the lens to the eyepiece. This allows a larger lens as well since you can widen the barrels of the binoculars but keep the eyepieces the same

NOTE porro prisms also inverts the image when placed in pairs. If you have a biconvex lens, you will have an upside down image if out of the focus range. The prisms corrects this by rotating the image (2d light beam array) 45 deg and 45 deg again. If you use a biconcave lense as the lens, you cant focus and wont get a good image

- thats why if you look at things that are too close, it may flip upside down?
