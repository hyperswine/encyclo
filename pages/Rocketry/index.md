Rockets are very good.

## Facts

Escape Velocity => 11.2 km/s

Escape Acceleration => 90 km/s^2

Rockets should always be launched straight upwards to minimise time spent in the dense lower atmosphere.

- then it can be slowly adjusted to tilt away into orbit and not be going head on against vertical gravity

Rockets are cyclindrical and stacked upon each other because it is a stable structure when launching directly upwards.

## Mass Driver

A cool use for a coilgun like system would be to have a helical circuit that accelerates a train (maglev-like) mass. Then it spirals outwards and upwards until it is vertical.

- while doing so at the last stages, the train starts to join together into one rocket system, about 20m long and 5m diameter
- cheaper to build 50m underground than above ground, the rest of the stuff above ground can also be connected to a mountainside to reduce the cost of stabilising the final stages

The whole circuit can be 350km underground and 100km above ground

This can give us a lot of acceleration. And since it will be unmanned, we dont have to compromise.

- accelerate it as fast as possible in a vaccum
- right as it exits the tube, ignite the chemical propellant
- should maintain muzzle velocity as it exits, should be quite fast as well, much faster than the average vertical launch rocket
